# USDOI Economics Community of Practice 2021 Python Training

Welcome to the USDOI Economics Community of Practice Python Training (virtual edition again!)  for 2021!

This year, we have two examples to explore and rather than installing python locally, we will run in binder - a cloud-based service. The good news is, no painful installation. The bad news is, storage is not persistent so you will have to save your work locally to keep things (more on that as we go)

# To activate the environment, click the 'launch' button below. First time it can take a few minutes
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnfienen/doi_econ_2021/main?urlpath=lab)

# Examples
_Disclaimer: The data used in these examples are real, but the analysis is naive - simply focused on illustrating the used of python and not to draw formal conclusions_
